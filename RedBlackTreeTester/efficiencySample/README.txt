===========
Despciption
===========
Use random generator (randomNumberSample.c -> raw.exe -> numberSample.txt) to generate scaled raw data.

Use tree builder ({red-blackBST.c,red-blackBST.h,BSTmain.c} -> tree.exe -> treeSample.txt) to  build a balanced red-black tree using data from last step.

And finally use treeSample.txt as testing material.

====================
Execute Instructions
====================
Execute raw.exe, tree.exe in sequence to get testing data.

==================
Build Instructions
==================
Use your own gcc compiler to build two project files:
	randomNumberSample.c -> raw.exe
	{red-blackBST.c,red-blackBST.h,BSTmain.c} -> tree.exe

Link three files for treeBuilder properly.//originally built with gcc version 4.9.2
